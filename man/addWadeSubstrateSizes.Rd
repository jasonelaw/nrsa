\title{Add substrate size variables to wadeable data}
\usage{
addWadeSubstrateSizes(uid, size.class)

wadeSubstrateSizes()

addBoatSubstrateSizes(uid, size.class)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{a vector of site-visit indicators}

\item{size.class}{a vector size class codes}
}
\description{
The substrate size metrics are calculated on variables representing four
different sets of the size class data. This function convert the size classes
to a diameter and logDiameter for each of those size classes (geometric mean
of the extreme sizes) for each of these sets. There are three data sets we
need to work with (1) ALL the size_classes (mm) (2) mobile subclasses; i.e., excluding HP,
RD, RR, RS, RC, OT, WD (tt) (3)  all classes and lumps the
boulder class (XB+SB= BL)  (bl) (4) mobile subclasses (i.e., excluding HP, RD, RR, RS, RC,
OT, WD) and lumps the boulder class (XB+SB= BL)  (ttbl)
}
\details{
The unexported wadeSubstrateSizes returns a data.frame of wadeable substrate sizes.
The "BL" class is included because although it isn't directly observed, it is needed 
for the lumped boulder data sets above.
