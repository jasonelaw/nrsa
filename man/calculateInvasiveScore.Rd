\title{Calculate total invasive score}
\usage{
calculateInvasiveScore(uid, metric, result, FUN = sum)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{a vector of site identifiers}

\item{result}{a vector of invasive metrics for each site.}
}
\value{
a 'metric' data.frame
}
\description{
Calculates the ip_score metric from the NRSA metrics.  This is just the sum of
the other invasice species metric scores for the site.  The metric is somewhat concerning if 
a survey doesn't use the stock EPA invasives list, because the metrics would
be incomparable.  The mean might be a better metric, although not much better.
}
\details{
For the ip_score to be useful, each site must have the same number and identity
of invasive species.  For this implementation, the metrics are subsetted
so that only the species on the original EPA NRSA list (f_myrspi, f_hydver, 
f_eiccra, f_nympel, f_lytsal, f_arudon, f_butumb, f_tamspp, f_rosmul, 
f_eupesu) are included in the calculation.
