\title{Calculate length of area sampled for LWD}
\usage{
calculateLWDSiteArea(lwdlength, xbkf_w, is.wadeable)
}
\arguments{
\item{lwdlength}{a vector of site lengths as returned by \link{calculateLWDSiteLength}}

\item{xbkf_w}{a vector of average bankfull width as returned by \link{calculateChannelMetrics}}

\item{is.wadeable}{a logical vector; \code{TRUE} if the site was wadeable}
}
\description{
\code{calculateLWDSiteLength} is used to calculate the area of the sampled
lwd plots so that counts/area can be calculated.
