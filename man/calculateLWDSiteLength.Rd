\title{Calculate length of area sampled for LWD}
\usage{
calculateLWDSiteLength(reachlen, numtran, is.wadeable)
}
\arguments{
\item{reachlen}{a vector of reachlength metrics for the sites. For wadeable,
sites use \link{calculateWadeableReachLength}. For Non-wadeable sites, use 
\link{calculateBoatableReachLength}.}

\item{numtran}{a vector with the number of transects sampled. Use \link{observedLWDTransects},
to determine the number of lwd transects measured.}

\item{is.wadeable}{a logical vector; \code{TRUE} if the site was wadeable}
}
\description{
\code{calculateLWDSiteLength} is used to calculate the length of the sampled
area so that counts/length and counts/area can be calculated. For wadeable,
sites the length of stream where lwd is sampled is just the total reach length
for the site, because the lwd plots are the entire area between the transects.
For non-wadeable sites, the site length is the number of sampled transects * 20,
because each littoral plot is 20 m long.
