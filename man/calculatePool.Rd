\title{Determine which depths in a vector of depths represent pools}
\usage{
calculatePool(distance, depth, slope, uid = NULL, convert.stack = F,
  pool.only = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{a vector of cumulative distance for the thalweg profile}

\item{depth}{a vector of thalweg profile depths}

\item{slope}{the average site slope; if uid is passed this is expected to be 
a vector as long as the other arguments.  Otherwise it may be a length 1
numeric.}

\item{uid}{a vector of site identifiers: pools are calculated separately for
each site}

\item{convert.stack}{logical, if \code{TRUE} the slope is converted using the
formula of Stack (1988).}

\item{pool.only}{logical, if \code{TRUE}, any nonpool points are removed from the
data.frame that is returned.}
}
\description{
Determine which depths in a vector of depths represent pools and return 
information about them.  A residual pool is any area in a pool that holds 
water when the discharge is 0.
