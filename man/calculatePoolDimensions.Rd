\title{Residual depths from a thalweg profile}
\usage{
calculatePoolDimensions(distance, depth, slope)
}
\arguments{
\item{distance}{a vector of distances along a thalweg profile}

\item{depth}{a vector of thalweg profile depth measurements}

\item{slope}{a site wide average slope of length 1}
}
\value{
a n * n lower diagonal matrix containing the residual depths.  Each 
  column represents the residual depths calculated treating a different
  thalweg point as the base depth.
}
\description{
Calculate residual pool depths from a thalweg profile containing distance 
depth and slope, treating every depth as a possible base depth.
}
\details{
The resulting residual depths are returned in the lower triangle of a n * n 
matrix, where n is the number of depths.  The diagonal of the matrix
represents the succesive base points. Each row after the diagonal gives the
residual depths relative to the base point for that column.  Any row with a
residual depth > 0 is in a pool represents a thalweg point that is in a pool.
