\usage{
calculatePoolMetrics(uid, pool, depth, length, area, reachlen, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{a vector of site identifiers}

\item{pool}{a pool identifier; unique for each pool within a site}

\item{depth}{the residual pool depth for that point in the profile}

\item{length}{the residual pool length for that point in the profile}

\item{area}{the residual pool area for that point in the profile}

\item{reachlen}{a vector of reach lengths for each uid;}
}
\value{
a metric data.frame
}
\description{
Calculates residual pool metrics from data set where the residual pool length,
depth, and area have been calculated separately for each depth in a thalweg profile.
