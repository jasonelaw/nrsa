\title{Calculates metrics of bankfull width to (bankfull height + depth) ratios}
\usage{
calculateTransectRatios(uid, bankwid, bankhgt, depth)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{a vector of site identifiers}

\item{bankwid}{a vector of bankfull widths; EPA uses the sum of the extra transects.}

\item{bankhgt}{a vector of bankfull heights; EPA uses the mean of the extra transects.}

\item{depth}{a vector of thalweg depths}
}
\description{
This function calculates summary metrics of the ratio: bankfull width / 
(bankfull height + thalweg depth).  The mean and count of measurements are
calculated.
}
\details{
The EPA calculations used extra transects in these calculations: 
sum of the bankfull widths at the extra transect and regular transect and the
mean of the bankfull height at the extra transect and the regular transect.  
These values are returned by the \link{joinExtraTransects} function.
