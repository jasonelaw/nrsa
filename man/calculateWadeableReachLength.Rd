\title{Calculates the reach length for a wadeable site}
\usage{
calculateWadeableReachLength(uid, n.station, increment)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{a vector of site identifiers}

\item{n.station}{the number of station per site}

\item{increment}{the distance between stations at a wadeable site}
}
\value{
a 'metric' data.frame
}
\description{
Calculates the reach length for a wadeable site using the number of stations per site
and the increment between stations.  The number of stations per site
must be calculated using \link{nWadeableStations} prior to passing
to this function.  Thus, the data passed to this function is site-level data.
}
\examples{
increment <- expand.grid(uid = 1:10, increment = 1.5)
d <- expand.grid(uid = 1:10, transects = LETTERS[1:11], station = 0:9)
n.sta <- nWadeableStations(d$uid, d$transects, d$station, by = 'site')
d <- merge(increment, n.sta, by = 'uid')
calculateWadeableReachLength(d$uid, d$n.sta, d$increment)
