\title{Identify the first and last elements for each run in a vector}
\usage{
first(x, na.as.group = F)

last(x, na.as.group = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector with runs}

\item{a}{logical vector; \code{TRUE} if it is the first or last of a run}
}
\description{
For an input vector which contains a sequence of runs, these functions identify
the first and last points in each run.  They return a logical vector.
}
\details{
These functions use \link{rle} to compute a run length encoding for the vector
and extract the first and last elements in each run from the lengths of each run.
}
\examples{
first(c(1,1,2,2))
last(c(1,1,2,2))
}
