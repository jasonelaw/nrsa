\title{Join extra side channel transects}
\usage{
joinExtraTransects(uid, transect, station, wetwid, bankwid, bankhgt, incishgt)
}
\description{
This function joins the extra side channel transects with the parallel transect.
Each measurement on the main channel is joined with the parallel measurement 
on the side channel using an aggregation function.  All measurements done at
the transect (rather than at a station) are assumed to be at station 0 for purposes
this function.  This allows us to do the join in one pass rather than separately.

\examples{
d <- data.frame(uid = c(1,1), transect = c('A', 'XA'), station = c(0,0), wetwid = 1:2, bankwid = 1:2, bankhgt = 1:2, incishgt = 1:2)
do.call('joinExtraTransects', d)
