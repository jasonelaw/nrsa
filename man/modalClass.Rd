\title{Determines most common classes, based on counts for each class.  Counts are
expected to occur in the same row (i.e. long format).  This function is
intended to be called from within a loop.  In the case of ties, all modal
classes will be included, separated by a comma and a space. e.g.}
\usage{
modalClass(x, values, classes)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{named values of interest, e.g. a single row of a dataframe}

\item{values}{list of column names in x containing cover or other values on
which the modal class will be based.}

\item{classes}{list of class names associated with the columns, given in the order
that the values are listed.}

a character vector

ASSUMPTIONS
Column names listed by values arg occur in x.
The list of class names is in the same order as the list of 
The number of elements in values is the number of elements in classes.
