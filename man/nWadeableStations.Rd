\title{Estimates the intended number of wadeable thalweg stations to be visited at
an NRSA study site.}
\usage{
nWadeableStations(uid, transect, station, by = c("transect", "site"))

nWadeableStationsPerTransect(uid, transect, station)
}
\arguments{
\item{uid}{a vector of site identifiers}

\item{transect}{a vector of transect identifiers}

\item{station}{a vector of station identifiers}

\item{by}{}
}
\description{
Estimates the intended number of wadeable thalweg stations at each transect
which are considered sampled (even if there is no data) for the purposes of
calculating residual pools and channel lengths.  The number of stations at
a transect is calculated as the greater of either the number of stations
occuring in the dataframe for that transect, or the most common count of
stations (i.e. station mode) occuring at that site.
}
\details{
It takes advantage of the fact that stations
are numeric, and thus that the last station to be expected for a transect
is the number of transects to be expected at that transect, adding 1 to
the station to account for station numbering starting at 0.  Transect K
always has 1 station.

The by option allows you to calculate the number of stations by site or transect.
Doing it by site makes the calculations of reach length (in 
\link{calculateWadeableReachLength}) easier.

nWadeableStations(d$uid, d$transects, d$station, by = 'site')
