\title{Renames metrics for human influence}
\usage{
renameHumanInfluenceMetrics(group, metric)
}
\arguments{
\item{group}{a vector of groups based on the names passed to meltMetrics}

\item{metric}{a vector metric indicators}
}
\description{
Renames human influence metrics based on a group variable (created by meltMetrics)
and a metric variable (created during grouping operations).  See calculateHumanInfluence
code for how the group vector and metric vector are created and what the values are.
This is definitely not to be called outside the nrsa package because it depends
expicitly on the code in calculateHumanInfluence.
